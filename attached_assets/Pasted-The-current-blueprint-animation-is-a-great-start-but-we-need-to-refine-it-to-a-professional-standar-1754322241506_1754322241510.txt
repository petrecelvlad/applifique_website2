The current blueprint animation is a great start, but we need to refine it to a professional standard. I have two specific upgrades that need to be implemented in the AnimatedBlueprint.tsx component.
Objective:
Refine the blueprint animation with two key upgrades: first, change the connector lines to have rounded corners for a softer, more architectural feel; second, make the animation trigger and replay based on the component's visibility as the user scrolls.
Instructions:
Part 1: Refine the Connector Line Aesthetics
Modify the SVG: In the AnimatedBlueprint.tsx component, locate the SVG markup.
Apply stroke-linejoin: For all the <path> or <line> elements that represent the connectors between the boxes, add the following SVG attribute: stroke-linejoin="round". This is a simple and effective way to soften the corners where lines meet.
Adjust stroke-width (Optional): You may want to slightly increase the stroke-width of the lines (e.g., to 2 or 3) to make the rounded corners more pronounced and visually pleasing.
Part 2: Implement Scroll-Triggered Animation
This is the most critical part. We will use the GSAP ScrollTrigger plugin.
Install/Import the Plugin:
First, ensure GSAP's ScrollTrigger is available. You may need to import it at the top of AnimatedBlueprint.tsx:
Generated javascript
import { gsap } from 'gsap';
import { ScrollTrigger } from 'gsap/ScrollTrigger';
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);
Use code with caution.
JavaScript
Refactor the useEffect Hook:
You will wrap the existing animation logic within a ScrollTrigger.create() block. This will link our animation timeline to the scroll position.
The useEffect hook should be rewritten to look like this:
Generated javascript
useEffect(() => {
    const componentContainer = /* reference to your component's main div */;
    const tl = gsap.timeline({ paused: true }); // Create the timeline but leave it paused

    // ... (Keep all your existing animation logic here: gsap.set(...), tl.to(...) for boxes, lines, text) ...
    
    // --- NEW SCROLLTRIGGER LOGIC ---
    ScrollTrigger.create({
        trigger: componentContainer, // The element that triggers the animation
        start: "top 80%", // Start when the top of the component is 80% down the viewport
        end: "bottom 20%", // End when the bottom of the component is 20% from the top
        // This is the magic part that handles replaying the animation
        toggleActions: "restart pause resume pause",
        // toggleActions means: onEnter, onLeave, onEnterBack, onLeaveBack
        // "restart" means: when it enters the screen (from bottom or top), play from the beginning.
        // "pause" means: when it leaves the screen (from bottom or top), pause it where it is.
        onEnter: () => tl.restart(),
        onEnterBack: () => tl.restart(),
    });

}, []); // Empty dependency array ensures this setup runs only once.
Use code with caution.
JavaScript
Ensure you have a container reference: Make sure the main div of your AnimatedBlueprint component has a ref so you can pass it to the trigger property of ScrollTrigger.
Execute these changes. The result should be a significantly more polished user experience where the diagram's lines are aesthetically pleasing, and the entire animation serves as a delightful, responsive "reveal" that plays fresh for the user every time they scroll to that section of the page.
