Hello Agent. We are making a final aesthetic and functional improvement to the blueprint animation. We need to change the connector lines from straight diagonals to clean, 90-degree orthogonal paths.
Objective:
Refactor the AnimatedBlueprint.tsx component to calculate and render right-angled connector lines, improving the diagram's readability by avoiding intersections with component boxes.
Instructions:
You will modify only one file: src/components/sections/AnimatedBlueprint.tsx.
Part 1: Create the Path Calculation Helper Function
Inside the AnimatedBlueprint.tsx file, but outside the main component function, create a new helper function. Let's call it createOrthogonalPath.
This function will accept four arguments: startX, startY, endX, endY.
Inside the function, implement a "Midpoint Routing" algorithm. It will calculate a path with two corners.
Calculate the horizontal midpoint: const midX = startX + (endX - startX) / 2;
The function must return an SVG path string in the following format:
Generated javascript
return `M ${startX} ${startY} L ${midX} ${startY} L ${midX} ${endY} L ${endX} ${endY}`;
Use code with caution.
JavaScript
This string tells the SVG to: Move to start, draw a line horizontally to the midpoint, draw a line vertically to the new Y level, and then draw a line horizontally to the end point.
Part 2: Integrate the Helper into the Component
Change Lines to Paths: In your component's SVG markup, you must ensure all connector lines are <path> elements, not <line> elements.
Calculate and Apply Paths:
The logic that renders the SVG will now need to first determine the coordinates of the boxes it's connecting.
For each connection, you will call your new createOrthogonalPath() helper function with the appropriate start and end coordinates.
You will then dynamically set the d attribute of each <path> element to the string returned by the helper function.
The animation logic (using GSAP's DrawSVGPlugin or the stroke-dasharray method) will not need to change. It will automatically work on the new, more complex <path> elements.
Execute this refactoring. The final result should be the same elegant animation, but with clean, right-angled connector lines that create a much more professional and readable architectural diagram. This is the final polish for our MVP demo.
